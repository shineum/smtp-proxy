This is a sample text file for testing SMTP attachments.
It contains multiple lines to verify the attachment encoding works correctly.

Line 1: Hello from smtp-proxy test data.
Line 2: Attachments are base64-encoded in the MIME message.
Line 3: The queue-worker should parse and log these correctly.
